## Problem • Insight • Solution

| Stage | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| **Problem** | Most wellness apps feel like chores: too much typing, generic advice, and zero follow-through. Busy people abandon them within days. |
| **Insight** | If you combine “just-for-me” meal inspiration with **one-tap tracking**, you remove the effort barrier and make healthy choices feel rewarding. |
| **Solution** | Guaco auto-generates realistic recipes from what you have adjusting to current needs, lets you log food/water/sleep/exercise in seconds, and rewards streaks with fun badges. |

## North-Star & Guardrail Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Why we picked it |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| **Healthy actions logged per active user per week** *(NSM)* | Count of meals, drinks, workouts, or sleeps logged ÷ weekly active users | Direct indicator the product is delivering core value (habit building) |
| 7-day Retention % | % of new users who return at least once between day 1–7 | Validates sustained engagement |
| Recipe Generation Success Rate | Successful AI recipe responses ÷ attempts | Ensures core feature reliability |

## Primary Personas

| Persona | Goals | Frustrations | Quote |
|---------|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Fitness-Focused Finn** (25, amateur runner) | Hit macro targets, see progress trends | Manual nutrition tracking is tedious | “I know what *should* work, but tracking everything kills my vibe.” |
| **Time-Poor Taylor** (32, junior lawyer) | Quick, healthy meals; zero planning overhead | Too busy to cook or log | “If it takes more than 3 taps, I’m out.” |
| **Recipe-Organised Riley** (29, food-loving parent) | Keep a tidy recipe vault, avoid waste | Juggling kids’ tastes and pantry stock | “Show me dishes I can *actually* cook tonight with what’s in the fridge.” |
