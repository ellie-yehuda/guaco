## Problem ‚Ä¢ Insight ‚Ä¢ Solution

| Stage | Summary |
|-------|---------|
| **Problem** | Most wellness apps feel like chores: too much typing, generic advice, and zero follow-through. Busy people abandon them within days. |
| **Insight** | If you combine ‚Äújust-for-me‚Äù meal inspiration with **one-tap tracking**, you remove the effort barrier and make healthy choices feel rewarding. |
| **Solution** | Guaco auto-generates realistic recipes from what you have adjusting to current needs, lets you log food/water/sleep/exercise in seconds, and rewards streaks with fun badges. |
